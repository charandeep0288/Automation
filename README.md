# Automation & Webscrapping

As we all know country is suffering from 2nd wave of COVID-19 and if one needs a doc they can really use this automation. So, automation is completed using java script this is the technical part now for the working part it allows you to access all the doctors near your location. Not only this it will provide you with the doctor's name, qualification, years of practice, pdf of route and directions, his/her contact number and most importantly if he/she is available or not. I hope you find this project useful. I would like to thank all the organisers who gave opportunity to all the students to showcase their ideas.
